# Pseudo-Random Number Generation in Go

The `math/rand` package provides support for generating pseudo-random numbers.

### Generating a Random Integer

You can generate a random integer between 0 and 99 as follows:

```go
import "math/rand"

n := rand.Intn(100) // n is a random int, 0 <= n < 100
```

## Generating a Random Floating Point Number
To generate a random floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, use the rand.Float64() function:

```go
f := rand.Float64() // f is a random float64, 0.0 <= f < 1.0
```

## Shuffling a Slice
There is also support for shuffling a slice (or other data structures). For example, to shuffle a slice of strings:

```go 
x := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"}

// Shuffling the slice puts its elements into a random order
rand.Shuffle(len(x), func(i, j int) {
    x[i], x[j] = x[j], x[i]
})
```

# Seeds
The number sequences generated by the math/rand package are not truly random. Given a specific "seed" value, the results are entirely deterministic.

## Automatic Seeding in Go 1.20+
Starting from Go 1.20+, the seed is automatically picked at random, so you will see different sequences of random numbers each time you run your program.

## Manual Seeding (Pre-Go 1.20)
In earlier versions of Go, the default seed was 1. To get different sequences for various runs of the program, you had to manually seed the random number generator. For example, using the current time:

```go
import "time"

rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
```

This seeds the random number generator with the current time in nanoseconds, ensuring different sequences in each run.
